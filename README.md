# src/app: 
This is the main directory for your application's code. It includes your pages, layouts, and any other components specific to your app.

# layout.tsx:
The layout.tsx file is where you can define the structure that should be consistent across multiple pages, like your navigation bar, footer, and any other elements that appear on every page. It helps keep your app's UI consistent and makes it easier to manage.
In Next.js, your layout.tsx acts similarly to a main app component in React. You would import your navigation bar, footer, and any other common components directly into the layout.tsx file. That way, every page that uses this layout will automatically have those components rendered. It’s a really neat way to keep everything consistent across your app!

# page.tsx: 
In Next.js, each file inside the app directory corresponds to a route in your application. The page.tsx file is essentially the entry point for a specific route. For example, if you have a file named page.tsx inside a folder called about, then that file will render the content for the /about route in your app.
So, basically, the page.tsx file is what you'll use to define the content and functionality for a specific page in your application. It's kind of like the main component for that particular route!

If you create a folder named about inside your app directory and place a page.tsx file inside it, it will automatically map to the /about route in your application. So, when users visit yourdomain.com/about, they'll see the content defined in that page.tsx file. It makes routing super intuitive and straightforward!

# eslint.config.mjs: 
This file contains the configuration for ESLint, which is a tool that helps you find and fix problems in your JavaScript or TypeScript code.

# next.config.ts: 
The next.config.ts file is where you configure various settings for your Next.js application. It allows you to customize the behavior of your app in several ways. Some common things you can do in this file include:
Custom Webpack configurations: If you need to modify how Webpack bundles your code, you can do that here.
Environment variables: You can specify different environment variables for development, testing, and production.
Redirects and rewrites: You can set up custom redirects and rewrites for your routes.
Image optimization: Configure settings for the Next.js image component.
Internationalization (i18n): Set up different locales for your app.

# tsconfig.json: 
This file contains the configuration for TypeScript. It specifies the compiler options, like which version of ECMAScript to target, which files to include, and other type-checking rules.

# Backend
For backend logic, you typically use the API routes feature. You can create an api directory inside the src folder, and then define your backend logic as individual files. Each file inside the api folder corresponds to an endpoint. For example, if you create a file named hello.ts inside src/api, it will create an endpoint at /api/hello.

This way, you can handle server-side logic, like database interactions, authentication, or any other API logic, all within your Next.js app. It keeps everything in one place and super convenient!
src/api/login.ts = /login

## How it works:
src/app/page.tsx → your homepage (/)

src/app/about/page.tsx → /about route

src/api/login/route.ts → backend endpoint at /api/login

src/app/layout.tsx → shared layout (navigation, footer, etc.)

This structure keeps frontend (in app/) and backend (in api/) neatly separated, but still inside the same Next.js project.
